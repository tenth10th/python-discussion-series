# Python Discussion Series

Some example code that explains various Python features and concepts.

Requirements: This code depends mostly on core Python 3.8+, but does also cover PyTest and relies on its test discovery features.

Gitpod should install the requirements automatically, but the manual equivalent would be:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
